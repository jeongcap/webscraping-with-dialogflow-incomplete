# webscraping-with-dialogflow-incomplete

This project was adapted after following the tutorial to make the 'silly Name Maker' project.
The Main focus is to be able to scrape a particular website and get some data, like articles' titles.

To make this possible I initially used request and cheerio, then I moved to request-promise and finally to request-promise-native, but i couldn't make this work (that's why there's the incomplete in the title).

P.s. the word 'prova' in the .js file means 'test' in italian.
